# Done — RunnersRotation

Date: 2025-09-23

This document summarizes the work completed to date with links to the relevant code areas and how to verify behavior locally.

## Visual/layout consistency
- Announcement bar and header
  - Announcement bar is fixed at the very top of the viewport.
  - Header/navigation is fixed immediately below the announcement bar.
  - Correct stacking (z-index) and body offset so page content never slides underneath.
  - Source:
    - Markup ordering: `app/components/layout/Layout.tsx`
    - Styles: `app/styles/homepage.css` (`.announcement-bar`, `.header`, `:root` layout variables, and `body` padding-top)
- Full-bleed navigation band
  - `.nav-main` renders as a full-width band using the 100vw technique without horizontal scroll.
  - Source: `app/styles/homepage.css` (nav band).
- Hero alignment and CTA containment
  - `.hero-card` is horizontally centered; grid parent enforces centering.
  - CTA constrained with `max-width: 100%` and gutters so it never touches the right edge.
  - Source: `app/styles/homepage.css` (`.hero-section`, `.hero-card`, `.hero-cta`).

## Product page improvements
- Live data wiring (Storefront API)
  - Product route (`/products/:handle`) queries Shopify Storefront by handle.
  - Minimal fields mapped and passed to existing components without changing HTML structure.
  - Source: `app/routes/products.$handle.tsx` (loader + links + shared `Layout`).
- DEV mock fallback (development only)
  - When `DEV_MOCK_PRODUCTS=1` and `NODE_ENV=development`, the product loader serves a mock product if none is found.
  - Enables local testing without Admin products.
  - Source: `app/routes/products.$handle.tsx`.
- Gallery and purchase UI
  - `ProductGallery` renders provided images; backgrounds use `contain` and `no-repeat` to prevent bleed.
  - `PurchaseCard` shows price/availability, formats currency, and disables CTA when unavailable.
  - Source: `app/components/ProductGallery.tsx`, `app/components/PurchaseCard.tsx`.

## CSS tokens and page grid
- Design tokens and scroll-driven blending remain centralized in `homepage.css`.
- `.page-container` grid is used at the body level; an extra nested wrapper in `Layout` was removed to avoid width inconsistencies.
- Source: `app/components/layout/Layout.tsx`, `app/styles/homepage.css`.

## How to run
- Development
  - `npm run dev` (starts Vite + Express with HMR)
- Build & start
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm start`

## Environment variables
Required (Storefront):
- `PUBLIC_STORE_DOMAIN`
- `PUBLIC_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN`
Optional:
- `PRIVATE_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN`
- `PUBLIC_STOREFRONT_ID`
- `SESSION_SECRET`

Development-only mock:
- `DEV_MOCK_PRODUCTS=1`
  - Add to `.env` at repo root, then restart the dev server.

Example `.env` snippet:
```
PUBLIC_STORE_DOMAIN=your-shop.myshopify.com
PUBLIC_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN=shpat_xxx
SESSION_SECRET=some-long-random-string
DEV_MOCK_PRODUCTS=1
```

## How to test
- Homepage: `/`
- Product page (real or mock): `/products/<handle>`
  - Example: `/products/books-cascadia-19-gtx`
  - With `DEV_MOCK_PRODUCTS=1`, returns a mock product if the handle isn’t found.
- Storefront connectivity demo: `/demo` (returns shop name JSON if configured)

## Notes
- If you notice header/announcement spacing off by a few pixels, adjust the layout variables in `:root`:
  - `--announcement-h` (default 40px)
  - `--header-h` (default 120px)
  These control both element positions and the body offset padding.# VELOCITY Running - Completed Tasks
