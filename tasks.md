# Tasks ‚Äî RunnersRotation

Date: 2025-09-23

This document tracks current work, what's done, and what's next.

## Completed
- Product route wired to live Storefront data (`app/routes/products.$handle.tsx`)
- DEV mock fallback for product route (`DEV_MOCK_PRODUCTS=1`)
- Shared Layout applied across routes (`app/components/layout/Layout.tsx`)
- Header fixed to top; announcement bar fixed above header; proper offsets and z-index (`app/styles/homepage.css`)
- Full-bleed nav band without horizontal scroll (`.nav-main`)
- Hero card centered; CTA respects right gutter (`app/styles/homepage.css`)
- Removed nested `.page-container` wrapper from `Layout` to avoid width inconsistencies

## In Progress
- Homepage live content (safe)
  - Replace static copy with Storefront data while preserving exact HTML/CSS/classes
  - Keep strict fallbacks for missing data

## Backlog / Next
- Thread cart count and collection links from route loaders into `Header`
- Tighten responsive metrics for `--header-h` across breakpoints if needed
- Add lightweight tests (type-level and minimal snapshots) for route loaders
- Documentation refinements as architecture evolves (server/client split if adopted)

## Notes
- Environment
  - Set up `.env` with Storefront credentials and optional `DEV_MOCK_PRODUCTS=1`
- Run
  - Dev: `npm run dev`
  - Build: `npm run build`
  - Start: `npm start`# VELOCITY Running - Modern Hydrogen Architecture Migration
